The Trie and TrieNode class is used as explained and defined in the udacity lesson with some modifications required for the autocomplete application. The most important class function in the implementation is the suffices_helper function to collect valid suffices for a given prefix. The suffices_helper function is a recursive function which collects and adds the valid results to a list structure which is returned by the autocomplete.
