The Trie and TrieNode class is used as explained and defined in the udacity lesson with some modifications required for the autocomplete application. The most important class function in the implementation is the suffices_helper function to collect valid suffices for a given prefix. The suffices_helper function is a recursive function which collects and adds the valid results to a list structure which is returned by the autocomplete. The time and space complexity for the implementation is primarily dictated by the insert and find functions. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the word. The space complexity of these functions is O(n*m) for insert where n is length of word and m number of words and O(1) for the find function.
